# GrocerySync3 Tasks

## Analysis and Understanding Phase
- [x] Review Home.tsx to understand app structure
- [x] Review ListView.tsx to understand list functionality
- [x] Review db.ts to understand database interactions
- [x] Review useSupabase hook to understand authentication

## Issues Found
1. In the `createList` function in db.ts:
   - [x] Using `owner` field when inserting into 'lists' table, but the type definition shows `owner_uuid`
   - [x] Inconsistency in field naming between code and database schema
2. Database functions lacked comprehensive error handling:
   - [x] Missing input validation
   - [x] Inconsistent error logging
   - [x] Insufficient error messages
3. The Invite page was not implemented yet (just a placeholder)
4. Items not persisting in the database:
   - [x] The createItem function was using a fallback that returned temporary items with 'temp-id' instead of properly saving to the database

   ```
   pnpm add sharp
   ```

2. The following scripts have been created:
   - `scripts/generate-icons.js` - Generates all the main icon sizes from the SVG source
   - `scripts/create-screenshots.js` - Creates placeholder screenshots for the manifest
   - `scripts/create-shortcut-icons.js` - Creates shortcut icons for the manifest
   - `scripts/create-wide-tile.js` - Creates wide tile icon for Microsoft browsers
   - `scripts/create-ios-icons.js` - Creates high-quality iOS-specific icons
   - `scripts/create-ios-splash.js` - Creates iOS splash screens for different devices
   - `scripts/generate-all-assets.js` - Runs all the above scripts in sequence

3. All the required directories have been created:
   - `public/icons` - Contains all icon assets
   - `public/screenshots` - Contains placeholder screenshots

4. The following configuration files have been created/updated:
   - `public/manifest.json` - Web app manifest
   - `public/browserconfig.xml` - Microsoft browser configuration
   - `public/service-worker.js` - Service worker for offline support
   - `public/index.html` - Updated with comprehensive meta tags and links for iOS support
